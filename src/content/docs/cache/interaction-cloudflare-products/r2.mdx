    content: Enable cache in an R2 bucket

---

To enable caching for a [Cloudflare R2](/r2/) bucket, make sure your bucket is public and accessible by the Cache. This can be done by creating a [Custom Domain](/r2/buckets/public-buckets/#custom-domains). Follow these steps to set up a Custom Domain for your bucket:

1. Go to **R2** and select your bucket.
2. On the bucket page, select **Settings**.
3. Under **Public access** > **Custom Domains**, select **Connect Domain**.
4. Enter the domain name you want to connect to and select **Continue**.
5. Review the new record that will be added to the DNS table and select **Connect Domain**.

This will generate a publicly available CNAME in the format `[name].domain.com`.

## Tiered Cache
By default Cloudflare will cache R2 content based on [cache rules](/cache/how-to/cache-rules/) at the Edge only.

Tiered cache can be enabled by configuring [Smart Tiered Cache](/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/#smart-tiered-cache) which will select an Upper Tier datacenter next to your R2 bucket for optimal performance.

## Additional considerations

- Apply access controls to your newly public bucket. Refer to [Control cache access with WAF and Snippets](/cache/interaction-cloudflare-products/waf-snippets/) for more information.
- Be aware of the [cacheable size limits](/cache/concepts/default-cache-behavior/#cacheable-size-limits) for files.
